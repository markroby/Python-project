## Overview

 This is a Python program that implements a calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions:** Square root, power, logarithm, sine, cosine, tangent.
- **Other Constants:** Pi (Π), Euler's number (e), Golden ratio (φ), Tau (τ).
- **Matrix Operations:** Matrix addition.
- **Inverse Operations:** Inverse trigonometric functions, square root, logarithm, exponential, percentage.
- **Unit Conversion:** Switch between degrees and radians.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Select the desired operation by entering the corresponding number.
3. Follow the prompts to input numbers and parameters as required.
4. View the calculated result.

## Additional Notes

- The calculator supports both degrees and radians for trigonometric functions.
- Matrix addition requires inputting the dimensions and elements of two matrices.
- Inverse operations allow you to calculate the inverse of certain functions.
